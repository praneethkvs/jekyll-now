title:  Setting up a BLockchain using MultiChain
---

### Overview:
This is a tutorial that walks you through the process of spinning up a blockchain using the MultiChain software
which people can download and run to design, deploy, and operate distributed ledgers (blockchains) that track
ownership of digital tokens or assets.

### Initial Setup:
#### Step:1  
The First thing we need to do is download the MultiChain software.
You can head on over to <www.multichain.com> and click "Download MultiChain" or 
click on the following link <https://www.multichain.com/download-install/>
which should directly take you to the download page as seen in the image below.

Select the correct version based on your operating system.
**Note: There is no supported Mac version for MultiChain as of now.**

#### Step:2  
Extract the downloaded zip file into a directory. You should see the following files.

#### Step:3
Open the extracted multichain folder then type in cmd into the address bar to open a command window. Note,
you should open the command window in the directory where MultiChain is stored or it won't work.
